# DocuWarePlatform.NETClient
*DocuWarePlatform.NETClient* makes it easy to start using [DocuWare Platform .NET API](http://help.docuware.com/sdk/platform).  

Here you will find a *Visual Studio* solution that contains a basic implemenation of a client showing how to use *Platform .NET API* and some examples showing basic operations you can do.  

This *Visual Studio* solution is supposed to complement examples that could be found on the help page of [DocuWare Platform .NET API](http://help.docuware.com/sdk/platform) and it could/will be updated more often than the help page which is usually updated once per release.

Additionally, everyone is very welcome to provide missing code examples.

### Source code
Clone the sources: `git clone https://github.com/DocuWare/DocuWarePlatform.NETClient.git`

### Building
You need at least *Visual Studio 2012* installation of any edition.
To get started:
* Clone the source code (see above).
* Open *src/Samples.sln* in *Visual Studio*

### Executing examples
In order to be able to execute examples provided you need a supported version of *DocuWare* system.  

### Supported DocuWare versions
This implementation uses the *DocuWare Platform .NET API* of ***DocuWare 6.8***.  
Most of the examples will also run with *DocuWare 6.5* or higher.
